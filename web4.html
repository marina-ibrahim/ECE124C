    	<p>If there’s a better hand-held street food than the gyro — flatbread stuffed with rotisserie-grilled meat, then topped with creamy tzatziki sauce — we don’t know what it is. The dish originated in Greece, and in more recent years has become popular across the world, including in the U.S.</p>
    	<p>Outside its home country, "gyro" is one of the most consistently mispronounced foods on the planet. The correct way to say it? Yee-roh.</p>
