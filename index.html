	   	<h4>Food</h4>
		Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. Food is usually of <em>plant</em> or <em>animal</em> origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as <em>carbohydrates</em>, <em>fats</em>, <em>proteins</em>, <em>vitamins</em>, or <em>minerals</em>. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.<br>
	    Historically, humans secured food through two methods: <em>hunting</em> and <em>gathering</em>em and <em>griculture</em>, which gave modern humans a mainly omnivorous diet. Worldwide, humanity has created numerous cuisines and culinary arts, including a wide array of <em>ingredients</em>, <em>herbs</em>, <em>spices</em>, <em>techniques</em>, and <em>dishes</em>.</div>
	    <div>
		<h3>Food sources</h3>
		Most food has its origin in plants. Some food is obtained directly from plants; but even animals that are used as food sources are raised by feeding them food derived from plants. Cereal grain is a staple food that provides more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop. <em>Corn</em>,<em>wheat</em>, and <em>rice</em> – in all of their varieties – account for 87% of all grain production worldwide.<br>

        Some foods not from animal or plant sources include various edible <em>fungi</em>, especially <em>mushrooms</em>. Fungi and ambient <em>bacteria</em> are used in the preparation of fermented and pickled foods like leavened bread, alcoholic drinks, cheese, pickles, kombucha, and yogurt. Another example is blue-green algae such as Spirulina.Inorganic substances such as salt, baking soda and cream of tartar are used to preserve or chemically alter an ingredient.</div>

    <div id="Diet Food" class="tabcontent">
        <h3>Diet Food</h3>
        <p>Diet food (or "dietetic food") refers to any food or beverage whose recipe is altered to reduce fat, carbohydrates, abhor/adhore sugar in order to make it part of a weight loss program or diet. Such foods are usually intended to assist in weight loss or a change in body type, although bodybuilding supplements are designed to aid in gaining weight or muscle.</p> 
        <p>The process of making a diet version of a food usually requires finding an acceptable low-food-energy substitute for some high-food-energy ingredient. This can be as simple as replacing some or all of the food's sugar with a sugar substitute as is common with diet soft drinks such as Coca-Cola (for example Diet Coke). In some snacks, the food may be baked instead of fried thus reducing the food energy. In other cases, low-fat ingredients may be used as replacements.</p>
        <p>In whole grain foods, the higher fiber content effectively displaces some of the starch components of the flour. Since certain fibers have no food energy, this results in a modest energy reduction. Another technique relies on the intentional addition of other reduced-food-energy ingredients, such as resistant starch or dietary fiber, to replace part of the flour and achieve a more significant energy reduction.</p>

	<div id="Medical Food" class="tabcontent">
        <h3>Medical Food</h3>
        <p>Medical foods are foods that are specially formulated and intended for the dietary management of a disease that has distinctive nutritional needs that cannot be met by normal diet alone. In the United States they were defined in the Food and Drug Administration's 1988 Orphan Drug Act Amendments and are subject to the general food and safety labeling requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In Europe the European Food Safety Authority established definitions for "foods for special medical purposes".</p>
        <p>Medical foods, called "food for special medical purposes" in Europe,are distinct from the broader category of foods for special dietary use, from traditional foods that bear a health claim, and from dietary supplements. In order to be considered a medical food the product must, at a min</p>
        <ol>
        	<li>be a food for oral ingestion or tube feeding (nasogastric tube)</li>
        	<li>be labeled for the dietary management of a specific medical disorder, disease or condition for which there are distinctive nutritional requirements, and</li>
        	<li>be intended to be used under medical supervision.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Medical foods can be classified into the following categories:</p>
        <ol>
        	<li>Nutritionally complete formulas</li>
        	<li>Nutritionally incomplete formulas</li>
        	<li>Formulas for metabolic disorders</li>
        	<li>Oral rehydration products</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div id="Frozen Food" class="tabcontent">
    	<h3>Frozen Food</h3>
    	<p>Freezing food preserves it from the time it is prepared to the time it is eaten. Since early times, farmers, fishermen, and trappers have preserved grains and produce in unheated buildings during the winter season. Freezing food slows down decomposition by turning residual moisture into ice, inhibiting the growth of most bacterial species. In the food commodity industry, there are two processes: mechanical and cryogenic (or flash freezing). The kinetics of the freezing is important to preserve food quality and texture. Quicker freezing generates smaller ice crystals and maintains cellular structure. Cryogenic freezing is the quickest freezing technology available utilizing the extremely low temperature of liquid nitrogen −196 °C (−320 °F)</p>
    	<p>Preserving food in domestic kitchens during modern times is achieved using household freezers. Accepted advice to householders was to freeze food on the day of purchase. An initiative by a supermarket group in 2012 (backed by the UK's Waste & Resources Action Programme) promotes the freezing of food "as soon as possible up to the product's 'use by' date". The Food Standards Agency was reported as supporting the change, providing the food had been stored correctly up to that time.</p>

    <div id="Traditional Food" class="tabcontent">
    	<h3>Traditional Food</h3>
    	<p>Traditional foods are foods and dishes that are passed through generations or which have been consumed many generations. Traditional foods and dishes are traditional in nature, and may have a historic precedent in a national dish, regional cuisine or local cuisine. Traditional foods and beverages may be produced as homemade, by restaurants and small manufacturers, and by large food processing plant facilities.</p>
    	<p>Some traditional foods have geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union designations per European Union schemes of geographical indications and traditional specialties: Protected designation of origin (PDO), Protected geographical indication (PGI) and Traditional specialities guaranteed (TSG). These standards serve to promote and protect names of quality agricultural products and foodstuffs.</p>
